# Python-Projects
The following are projects that I created at the University of South Florida.

The first folder named realworld contains a data set CSV file that has countries GDP within. The programs that were written in Python helped read that data and plot both a bar graph and a pie chart for visualization.

Another file that is related to visualization is the GraphingGPSCommands program. Within this file, I take the GPS.csv and graph how many time certain commands are requested. There is both a line and a bar graph within, however one is commented out.

Next, is another file that is related to the GPS.csv files. The PlottingACruise program takes the two csv files, finds them within the system, then reads the files. Once the files are read, the program then plots the GPS coordinates on a plot to show were the user has gone. It does this for both files.

Lastly, the MLB program was similar in which it read the MLB.csv file, then searched through each line to find the batting average of each player. It then calculated the average of every single players batting average and printed their name, their average, and the total average of all players.
